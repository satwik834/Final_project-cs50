# TaskMaster
#### Video Demo:  <[URL HERE](https://youtu.be/XEamtXnFh60)>
#### Description:
So, TaskMaster is basically a todolist web app that can also track the time you spend on each individual task,made using html,bootstrap,javascript on the front end and flask on the backend and sql database for the data storage, it has a simple UI and is very easy to use.

### Front-end:
 - HTML,CSS(BootStrap),JavaScript
### Back-end:
 - Flask
### Database:
 - SQL Database(SQLite)

### Features
coming to the features of this web app , you can create an account which will be stored in the database and all your todos will be associated with your account and can be accessed as you left them(by that i mean you can add them or delete them) anytime and anywhere(if this web app is deployed),the todos are also stored in the database and not in the local storage so they can be accessed on any device by logging in with your account, the tracking feature works as follow: you can start the timer on any of the tasks you added to your list and as soon as you stop the timer the time you s;evpent on the task will the added to the database which can be retrieved later at any time on any device(if deployed) no the time is stored in the form a unix timestamp which is converted by the javascript front end to display hours minutes and seconds
coming to each of the files and folders:
### app.py:
heart of the web app, defines all the routes of my web app inluding the index page which retrieves and displays all the todos of the user from the database(we will get to how it retrieves it later)the login and register route are self explanatory.
some of the routes worth mentioning are
 - /addtodo - does not accept a GET request . this route is designed to let javascript add todos to the database ,now i have considered desining the app such that a form is submitted each time a todo is added but that would be too lazy, fetch api is something i learned while impplemeting this
- /deletetodo - this too is used by the frontend(javascript ) to delete todos from the database using fetch api
- /updatetime - used by the front end to update the time spent on a task
- /gettime - used by the front end to retrive the time spent on a task,the task information is sent using a POST request and the backend responds with the time

### helpers.py:
this contains the majority of the functions that deal with the database like adding a user to the database(signup()) and checking if they are registered(signin()) when they sign in. other functions include:
 - get_todos() -  to get the list of todos of a user from the database to display in the main page
 - get_userid() - the get the userid of a user from their email they entered
 - add_todo,delete_todo , self explanatory
 - gettime(),updatetime() are used to retrive and update the time stored in the database

### templates:
contains all the html files for the home page, sign in and register pages
 - layout.html - provides the base layout for the rest of the html files
 - login.html - login form for users to login to their accounts
 - register.html - registration form for creating new user accounts
 - index.html - main page that contains the todos and tracking feature


### database:
the database contains two tables: 1.users 2.todos
#### users:
this table contains the user information and has 3 columns:
1. the email address
2. hashed password
3. an autogenerated unique user id for each user
#### todos:
this table is used to store all the todos. it contains three columns
1. unique user id of the user(from the users table)
2. the actual task content
3. time spent on each task in the form of unix timestamp

### Learnings From this Project
1. learned how to implement a database
2. learned how to communicate between the back-end and front-end using fetch api especially with adding/deleting todos  and updating/retrieving time from the database
3. gained knowledge about asynchronous functions(await,promises,etc)


### Thing that can be improved going forward
1. adding a priority system for the tasks
2. the UI can be improved to look a lot cleaner
3. a local app can be developed to track time spent on different apps and display it on the website



### design choices
At the beginning of this project i have considered using firebase as a backend for this project but considering the scope of this project and the need to focus on the core functionality at the early stage i have decided to just use a local sql database for this project.however, in future iterations of this project i could see myself using firebase or any other Baas(backend as a service) products
